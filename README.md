   ```
   This will:
   - Stop and remove all containers
   - Remove volumes (clearing all data)
   - Rebuild and restart services
   - Reinitialize database with base schema
   - Create an admin user

2. **Database backup and restore**:
   ```bash
   # Create a backup
   ./opentr.sh backup
   
   # Restore from backup
   ./opentr.sh restore backups/backup_file.sql
   ```

3. **Initialize database only** (without full reset):
   ```bash
   ./opentr.sh init-db
   ```

#### Development Workflow

1. **Restart services** without database reset:
   ```bash
   # Restart backend services only
   ./opentr.sh restart-backend
   
   # Restart frontend only
   ./opentr.sh restart-frontend
   
   # Restart all services
   ./opentr.sh restart-all
   ```

2. **Rebuild services** with code changes:
   ```bash
   # Rebuild backend
   ./opentr.sh rebuild-backend
   
   # Rebuild frontend
   ./opentr.sh rebuild-frontend
   
   # Rebuild all
   ./opentr.sh build
   ```

3. **Access containers**:
   ```bash
   # Open a shell in a container
   ./opentr.sh shell backend
   
   # Available containers: backend, frontend, postgres, redis, minio, opensearch
   ```

### üöÄ Production Deployment

For production deployment, OpenTranscribe uses optimized builds and configurations:

1. **Configure production environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create production environment file
   cp .env.example .env.prod
   
   # Edit .env.prod with production settings:
   # - NODE_ENV=production
   # - Strong, unique passwords for all services
   # - Resource limits based on your hardware
   # - JWT secrets and security settings
   # - SSL/TLS configuration
   ```

2. **Start production environment**:
   ```bash
   # Start in production mode
   ./opentr.sh start prod
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Build optimized production images
   - Start only necessary services
   - Configure NGINX for production frontend
   - Set up proper security headers
   - Enable production optimizations

3. **Production maintenance**:
   ```bash
   # Check service health
   ./opentr.sh health
   
   # View production logs
   ./opentr.sh logs
   
   # Create database backup
   ./opentr.sh backup
   
   # Clean up unused resources
   ./opentr.sh clean
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - üåê **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (production build served via NGINX in container)
   - üîå **API**: http://localhost:8080/api (optimized FastAPI without debug/reload)
   - üå∫ **Flower**: http://localhost:5555/flower (for monitoring tasks) 

4. Important production considerations:
   - üîí **Security**: Set strong passwords in the .env file and limit access to admin interfaces
   - üõ°Ô∏è **Reverse Proxy**: Configure a proper reverse proxy (NGINX) with SSL/TLS certificates
   - üî• **Firewall**: Set up appropriate firewall rules to protect services
   - üíæ **Backups**: Implement automated backups for the database and object storage
   - üìà **Monitoring**: Set up health checks and system monitoring
   - üîÑ **Updates**: Establish a process for safe updates and migrations

> **Note**: The frontend-prod service in docker-compose.yml builds the Svelte application with production optimizations and serves it using NGINX, which is more efficient than the development server. This is the key difference between development and production modes.

  - AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)
  - OGG (open source audio format)

- üé¨ **Video Formats**: 
  - MP4 (most widely supported)
  - MOV (QuickTime format)
  - AVI (older but widely supported)
  - MKV (high quality container with multiple tracks)
  - WEBM (optimized for web)

### üîÑ Transcription Process

When you upload a file to OpenTranscribe, a sophisticated process begins:

1. üì§ **Upload & Storage**: The file is streamed to MinIO (S3-compatible object storage)
2. üìã **Job Creation**: A transcription job is created and queued in Celery with appropriate priority
3. üß† **Audio Processing**: 
   - Audio is extracted from video files if necessary
   - Audio is normalized and prepared for transcription
   - Faster-Whisper processes the audio to generate text with timestamps
4. üë• **Speaker Analysis**: PyAnnotate analyzes the audio for different speakers and creates voice embeddings
5. üîó **Alignment**: The transcript and speaker information are aligned and merged
6. üíΩ **Storage & Indexing**: 
   - Results are saved to the PostgreSQL database
   - Text and metadata are indexed in OpenSearch for fast retrieval
   - Speaker embeddings are stored for future recognition
7. üîî **Notification**: The UI shows progress and notifies when complete via WebSockets

> **Note**: ‚ö†Ô∏è The transcription process is resource-intensive and currently under optimization. Processing long files may take significant time depending on your hardware. GPU acceleration significantly improves performance when available.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

- üñ•Ô∏è **GPU not detected**: 
  - Verify your NVIDIA drivers are properly installed: `nvidia-smi` should display your GPU
  - Ensure CUDA is installed and compatible with the container runtime
  - Check that the appropriate devices are passed to the container in docker-compose.yml
  - Try setting USE_GPU=false in .env for CPU-only operation (will be slower)

- üéûÔ∏è **Media processing errors**: 
  - Ensure FFmpeg is properly configured in the container
  - Check if your media file is corrupted or in an unsupported format
  - Look at the celery-worker logs for specific error messages
  - Try converting your media using an external tool first

- üê¢ **Slow transcription**: 
  - Consider using a smaller Whisper model variant (medium or small instead of large)
  - Add more GPU memory to the worker container
  - For very long files, consider splitting them into smaller segments
  - CPU transcription is significantly slower than GPU - consider GPU hardware

- üóÑÔ∏è **Database issues**:
  - If PostgreSQL fails to start, check if the port is already in use
  - Use the reset_and_init.sh script to reinitialize the database
  - Check if the database name matches in all configurations (should be 'opentranscribe')

- üåê **Network issues**:
  - Ensure all ports specified in docker-compose.yml are available
  - Check if firewalls or proxies are blocking connections between services

### üìä Logs and Monitoring

To view logs for specific services, use the following commands:

```bash
# Backend API logs
docker compose logs -f backend

# Celery worker logs (AI processing)
docker compose logs -f celery-worker

# Frontend development server logs
docker compose logs -f frontend

# Production frontend logs
docker compose logs -f frontend-prod

# Database logs
docker compose logs -f postgres

# All logs combined
docker compose logs -f
```

For convenience during development:
- The start-dev.sh script automatically opens separate log windows for each service
- The reset_and_init.sh script also opens logs after initialization
- Flower dashboard (http://localhost:5555/flower) provides detailed task monitoring

### üîÑ Reset and Recovery

If you encounter persistent issues, a full reset often helps:

```bash
# Full development reset
./reset_and_init.sh dev

# Full production reset
./reset_and_init.sh prod
```

This will stop all containers, remove volumes (clearing all data), and restart with a fresh environment.
