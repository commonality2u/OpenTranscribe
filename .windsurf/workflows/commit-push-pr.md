description: Push changes to the github repo
---

1. Add all modified files
2. create a detailed commit message and commit files
3. Push branch to origin
4. create a detailed PR based on all the changes
5. merge the PR to the master branch
6. delete current branch that we just pushed
7. checkout master and pull the latest pushed changes.

If there are any errors with this process, as me for help so we do not break git or file changes.
